### Abstract

### Data & Model
The dataset used in this project was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification). The goal for this project is to identify the type of the garbage when providing an image. The original dataset has 2,467 observations which contains 6 classifications: `cardboard (393)`, `glass (491)`, `metal (400)`, `paper(584)`, `plastic (472)` and `trash(127)`. Example pictures for each category can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification).
